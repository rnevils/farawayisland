// place files you want to import through the `$lib` alias in this folder.

// the decision is do I use this directory (or lib/srever specivifcally) for my calculations? or just put it right in the results right?

// would make sense to put here if utilities wer used accross app, but everything is really just in results, so like saying goes - i should put related code close together directory

// yeah really don't need the server folder right? should be able to move stuff here

// also is it any faster if its in this file vs on server side.?
// probably faster local unless the device is weak so idk
